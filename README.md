# Hi, I'm Jerchiel! 
In case you're having a hard time trying to figure out how to pronounce my name, I'll make it easier for you! It's pronounced Jer-shell. I'm currently working as a healthcare worker (specifically a medical assistant) and I want to make the transition to become a data analyst. Over the course of 1-1.5 years, I've been slowly putting into practice everything (so far) I've learned as a data analyst. I would like to use this to showcase the projects I've done, also to receive any feedbacks on them!
